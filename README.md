This is a small project I made after being frustrated with cooking timer websites. I don't have a mechanical one, and I often have to track the timing of multiple things, which none of these websites do particularly well.

Instead of opening multiple timer pages and trying to remember what each was for, I made this instead! Features will include ability to have multiple timers with your own defined titles/notes (to remind you what they're for). It will also have the ability to play, pause, reset or remove the timers individually or all at once.

If it works well enough I'll give it's own .io domain befitting of its vaguely-pastel colour scheme...
